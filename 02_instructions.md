# General Instructions for this Repository

## How to use this repository
 - Every folder has a set of beginning
   notes filled with information you need
 - Every folder has a set of challenges
   afterwards to create something with
   what you've read so far
 - Not everything will be in the notes,
   you WILL have to find information online
   to figure out a solution to some challenges.
   That's part of the fun and where the
   learning will come from
 - To submit answers, upload your project to
   github and send the link to me. This will
   fill your github page with many different
   repositories, so keep them organized

## Tips and Things to Remember
 - These challenges will eventually lead to
   bigger and bigger projects that can
   then turn into actual applications for
   resume purposes
 - It's ok to ask questions and ask for clarity,
   it also helps to improve the program
 - Stationary guides (such as git, venv's, and IDE
   setup) will all be in one spot for reference
 - Expand your projects. If you finish early, try
   and make it better, faster, or change the
   code to make it easier to read
