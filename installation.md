Python
------
 - Go to python.org and click the downloads tab
 - Click the big yellow button right below the
   "Download the latest version" text
 - As of the making of this tutorial, the latest
   version is 3.8.2 but any version after will suffice
 - This will download the installer for your operating
   system, run the installer when it is done downloading
 - Leave the default options as is as they are not
   important at this time, nor do they matter. The big
   option that NEEDS to be checked is "Add Python to PATH"
 - The PATH is the operating systems way of finding,
   programs. Python is a program and we want our computer
   to be able to find it. Otherwise, you may get an error
   saying you don't have Python installed
 - Also, make sure to check the box that says
   "Disable PATH limit", this just makes sure nothing in
   the previous step gets jumbled up
 - After all this Python should be installed. To double
   check, we need to make sure we can run the program that
   reads python files. This is known as the "interpreter"
 - Open Powershell or CMD through the Windows start button, 
   and type the command Python. If you see an error message,
   something went wrong. Get me for help if this happens.
   If you see some information about Python, and your prompt
   changes to show ">>>", then you have successfully
   installed Python. You can close powershell or type `quit()`
   to get out of the prompt
