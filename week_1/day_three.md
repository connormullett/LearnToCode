 - While loops
 - For loops

## Loops
 - Loops are used to continuosly
   execute blocks of code
 - This can be useful if you want
   to perform the same operation
   or algorithm multiple times
 - for example, lets say we have
   a dataset of random numbers that
   have some form of benign meaning
   to someone else, but they only want
   to perform the research on numbers
   greater than 0, we can use a loop to
   `iterate` over the data and check with
   an if statement to see if each number
   is greater than 0
