# What you will Learn
 - Booleans
 - Operators and evaluations
 - Control flow with `if` statements
 - redirecting logic with `else`


## If Statements
 - If statements are used to ask
   questions in code. We use them
   to execute chunks of code based
   on a `condition`
 - A condition is a true or false
   evaluation
 - An evaluation is the outcome
   of an expression that results in
   a true or false value
 - For example
   `19 < 20` is true because 19 is
   less than 20


## Challenge
 - A movie theatre needs a program
   to keep kids out of rated R movies
   and suggest movie ratings based on age
 - Write a program that takes an age as
   input and check if they are over 18
   and under 13
 - IF they are OVER 18, they can see 
   rated R movies, IF they are under 13
   they can only see G and PG movies
 - Display the result in a nicely
   formatted and easy to understand
   message back to the user


## If you get stuck
 - What data type is returned from
   an input? can we change it
   to an integer?
 - Look up equality operators
 - Look into else statements


## When you are done
 - Try and clean up the code, refactor
   and make it use as few lines as possible
 - What if a parent is present? Add a new
   feature so that it asks if a parent is
   present and add new checks based on
   the new information
